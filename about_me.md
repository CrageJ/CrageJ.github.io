Hi, I'm Josh!

I'm a software developer based in Adelaide, Australia. I'm a master's student studying Machine Learning and AI.

This website is a blog to document my learning, showcase my projects, and talk about anything else that might be interesting. At the moment, I'm interested in AI/ML systems, backend development, and datastructure/algorithm design.

If you have an opportunity available or would just like to talk, you can find me on:

| Twitter  | Leetcode |  |
