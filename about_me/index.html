<p>Hi, I’m Josh!</p>

<p>I’m a software developer based in Adelaide, Australia. I’m a master’s student studying Machine Learning and AI.</p>

<p>This website is a blog to document my learning, showcase my projects, and talk about anything else that might be interesting. At the moment, I’m interested in AI/ML systems, backend development, and datastructure/algorithm design.</p>

<p>If you have an opportunity available or would just like to talk, you can find me on:</p>
